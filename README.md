# Randomization Expectations
Exploration of the limits of statistical expectations when randomizing subjects to two groups.

When subjects are randomized into two groups, the statistical "expectation" is that, for a given parameter, the means of the groups for that parameter will be "equal". This code is an exploration of whether what happens when randomizing subjects to groups, over various sample sizes, actually results in "equal" means.
